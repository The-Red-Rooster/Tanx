# CS447 Project 2: Tanx!
A game created and produced by Matthew Schofield, Joseph Van Boxtel, Benjamin Eavenson, and Henry Unruh for WSU's CS447 Game Design course.

# Project Goal - Synopsis.
The goal of this project was to develop a game in a certain time-frame with a team of people. This game is to have multiplayer support and is to be relatively complex, similar to the old-school game: Gauntlet. Our team decided to create a local-multiplayer game inspired by Worms called Tanx.

# Tanx - What is it?
Tanx is a worms/shellshock-like clone. Players take control of tanks on the field and take turns shooting at one another. The last tank(s) standing wins!
